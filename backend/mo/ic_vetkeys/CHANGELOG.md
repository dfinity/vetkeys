# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

- BREAKING CHANGE: Fixed an inconsistency with the Rust backend in the signature format returned by `ManagementCanister.signWithBls`. Before, we returned the full response from `vetkd_derive_key` while we only need the last 48 bytes, which is the signature. Also, added a check to `signWithBls` which traps if the provided vetKD key id is not `#bls12_381_g2`.

- BREAKING CHANGE: Fixed an inconsistency with the Rust backend in the returned text error messages. Two error messages were starting with a capital instead of small letter. This is now fixed.

- BREAKING CHANGE: Extract state to state structures to separate the data from the state. This enables enhanced orthogonal persistence by declaring actors to be `persistent`.
