# Internet Computer (IC) vetKeys

This package contains a set of tools designed to help canister developers integrate **vetKeys** into their Internet Computer (ICP) applications.

## [Key Manager](https://mops.one/ic-vetkeys/docs/key_manager/KeyManager)
A canister library for derivation of encrypted vetkeys from arbitrary strings. It can be used in combination with the [frontend key manager library](https://dfinity.github.io/vetkeys/classes/_dfinity_vetkeys_key_manager.KeyManager.html).

## [Encrypted Maps](https://mops.one/ic-vetkeys/docs/encrypted_maps/EncryptedMaps)
An efficient canister library facilitating access control and encrypted storage for a collection of maps contatining key-value pairs. It can be used in combination with the [frontend encrypted maps library](https://dfinity.github.io/vetkeys/classes/_dfinity_vetkeys_encrypted_maps.EncryptedMaps.html).

## Cross-language library
If Rust better suits your needs, take a look at the [Rust equivalent of this library](https://docs.rs/ic_vetkeys).
